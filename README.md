# Heart-rate-measurement-using-camera

# Abstract
- Heart Rate is one of the most important Physiological parameter and a vital indicator of people‘s physiological state
- A non-contact based system to measure Heart Rate: real-time application using camera
- Principal: extract heart rate information from facial skin color variation caused by blood circulation 
- Application: monitoring drivers‘ physiological state

# Methods 
- Detect face, align and get ROI using facial landmarks
- Apply band pass filter with fl = 0.8 Hz and fh = 3 Hz, which are 48 and 180 bpm respectively
- Average color value of ROI in each frame is calculate pushed to a data buffer which is 150 in length
- FFT the data buffer. The highest peak is Heart rate
- Amplify color to make the color variation visible 

# Requirements
- numpy, opencv, dlib, imutils, scipy, PyQt4
- Download and put file "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" in the project folder

# Implementation
- Install all needed packages
- Run GUI.py, appplication can run on either camera or video mode
```
python GUI.py
```
- In case of plotting graphs,run "graph_plot.py" 

# Results
- TODO: compare with HR data from a PPG device

# Note
- Application can only detect HR for 1 people at a time
- Sudden change can cause incorrect HR calculation. In the most case, HR can be correctly detected after 10 seconds being stable infront of the camera
